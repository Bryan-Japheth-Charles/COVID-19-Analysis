## üìÇ Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 patient-level data to uncover patterns, risk factors, and outcomes. The analysis was performed in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, followed by the creation of an **interactive Tableau dashboard** for visualization.

Key objectives:
- Explore patient demographics and profiles.
- Investigate comorbidities and their impact on outcomes.
- Assess hospitalization, ICU admissions, intubation, and mortality.
- Provide interactive visual analytics for deeper insights.

## üìä Tableau Dashboard Topics
The dashboard is divided into four main sections:

1. **Classification and Final Outcome** ‚Äì Case classification (confirmed/suspected) and survival outcomes.  
2. **Patient Profile** ‚Äì Age, sex, and patient type (inpatient vs outpatient).  
3. **Comorbidities and Death** ‚Äì Relationship between diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, etc.) and mortality.  
4. **Clinical, Pneumonia & Pregnancy** ‚Äì Analysis of pneumonia cases, ICU admission, intubation, and pregnancy-related outcomes.
